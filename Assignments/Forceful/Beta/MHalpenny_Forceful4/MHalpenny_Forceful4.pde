//The user controls the ball with their mouse, it will be pulled towards the mouse position. The ball
//responds to physical propeties such as velocity and acceleration which will affect how the game is played. 
//The goal is to amass as much text as possible, doing so will increase the balls mass (density in this case) and 
//create a growing field around the ball. The balls density will affect it within the tar traps, so it is crucial to 
//avoid these while large as the player will get immobilized. As the ball becomes denser is will become easier for text
//to seperate from the ball, meaning you can lose points. This is based off atomic properties where larger elements lose
//eletrons more easily due to distance from the electromagnetic core. To avoid this the blue power ups will grant a 
//stronger pull on the text. Magnets will also attempt to pull away text, they are to be avoided.
