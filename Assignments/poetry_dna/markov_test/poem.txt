my ice skates on a wall 
lustre of stumps washes his lavander horizon 
he’s got a handsome face of a lousy kid 
rooming-houses dirty fingers 
whistled in the shadow 
Wait for me at the detour 
river… snow… some one vague faded in a mirror 
filigree of trade winds 
clouds white as lace circling the pepper trees 
the film is finished 
memory died when their photos weather-worn points of 
polluted water under the trees in the mist shadow of  
boys by the daybreak in the peony fields cold lost 
marbles in the room carnations three ampoules of 
morphine little blue-eyes-twilight grins between his 
legs yellow fingers blue stars erect boys of sleep 
have frozen dreams for I am a teenager pass it on 
flesh and bones withheld too long yes sir yes yes 
Jones last map… lake… a canoe… rose tornado in 
the harvest brass echo tropical jeers from Panama 
City night fences dead fingers you are in your own body 
around and maybe a boy skin spreads to something 
else on Long Island the dogs are quiet
