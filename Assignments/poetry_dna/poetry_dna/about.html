  Poetry.dna explores the relationship between the organic and the mechanical, the evolving nature of organisms and the static patterns found within code. Poetry.dna is a generative poetry bot that is modelled after biological principles such as evolution, mutation, and self-regulation.  It was created using standard web coding practices, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, AJAX, and JSON. Inspired by artificial intelligences that learn based on associative phrasing (such as twitter bots) this project is given the capacity to create unique phrasing, wording, and formatting on it’s own accord. This ability is passed on through JavaScript where Poetry.dna is given a large array of data about the English language (thanks to RiTa.js) and the use of mathematics such as Markov chains. What makes Poetry.dna different is it has no end goal. Most modern AI learns through a process that involves reward systems upon correct identification, we call this training. Poetry.dna does not learn in the sense one might traditionally expect from an AI, instead of a static algorithm that dictates its creative direction it was instead modelled after nature. The project is inspired by natural phenomenon such as evolution, but most “evolutionary” concepts employed within AI are not actually evolutionary. Evolution does not have an end goal, when a mutation occurs the organism either dies, or passes on their genes. AI evolution typically evolves to a specified point, when it reaches that point it is deemed successful. Poetry.dna does not have an end point, like in nature it evolves at random and does not move solely forwards but possibly backwards, it is always in a state of flux and self-regulation. It has corrective mechanisms to attempt homeostasis within its coding, but it is not always guaranteed. Meaning this poetry bot is impossible to predict and creates truly organic poems.

	Why would one want to have a bot without goals? Poetry.dna is a meditation on current coding paradigms. Coding within AI fields is always expected to produce tangible results within a specified field. But code can operate on a different level. By allowing Poetry.dna to self-evolve the mechanistic properties associated with computer intelligence are brought much closer to the organic realm. Not only does this project attempt to shed light on the processes of machines, but also how nature operates. Nature is not a perfect system, it is chaotic and disruptive. We have forgotten just how chaotic nature can be and if we are to model machines after nature we cannot forget its roots.
